# AI-Powered Agent Status - July 31, 2:00 PM

## Current State: ✅ Working Locally, 🔧 Docker In Progress

### ✅ Completed
- **SLIM Communication Fixed**: Resolved missing `Slim` class by copying working `__init__.py` from main branch
- **AI-Powered Agents Working**: Both question and answer agents successfully communicate using Google AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- **Local Testing Successful**: End-to-end AI conversation working with SLIM infrastructure
- **Docker Setup Prepared**: Updated Dockerfiles to include SLIM bindings installation

### 🔧 Current Work: Docker Containerization
- **Issue**: SLIM server container configuration needs clarification
- **Progress**: 
  - Created `setup.py` for SLIM bindings local installation
  - Updated Dockerfiles to copy and install SLIM bindings from source
  - Modified `requirements.txt` to remove non-existent `slim-bindings` package
- **Next**: Resolve SLIM server Docker image for complete containerized testing
