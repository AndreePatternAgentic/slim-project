# Docker Container Debug Analysis

## What is "Distroless"?

**Distroless is INTENDED and GOOD** - it's a security best practice:

1. **Distroless containers** contain only your application and its runtime dependencies
2. **No shell, no package managers, no unnecessary tools** - reduces attack surface
3. **Much smaller and more secure** than regular containers
4. **This is the intended production setup** for SLIM

## Problem Analysis

You followed the steps correctly from the README. The issues are:

### Issue 1: Wrong Docker Stage
When you built without specifying `--target`, Docker used the last stage in the Dockerfile:
- **What we got**: `mcp-proxy-release` stage (contains `/slim-mcp-proxy`)
- **What we need**: `slim-release` stage (contains `/slim`)

### Issue 2: Build Failure
The Docker build failed during the `task -v data-plane:fetch` step, so the binary wasn't properly built.

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile has multiple stages (lines 78, 87, 94, 101):
- `slim-debug` (has shell + `/slim`)
- `slim-release` (distroless + `/slim`) ← **This is what we want**
- `mcp-proxy-debug` (has shell + `/slim-mcp-proxy`)
- `mcp-proxy-release` (distroless + `/slim-mcp-proxy`) ← **This is what we got**

## Solutions

1. **Use existing container with correct binary**: `/slim-mcp-proxy` instead of `/slim`
2. **Rebuild targeting correct stage**: `--target slim-release`
3. **Build locally with Rust/Cargo** (if Rust installed)

## Status
Your documentation is perfect - you followed the README exactly. The issue is architectural, not procedural.
