# SLIM Project Status - July 29, 2025 @ 6:10 PM PST

## Current Status: ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE READY, AGENTS CONFIGURED

### What's Working
- **✅ SLIM Server**: Running on `localhost:46357`, accepting connections
- **✅ Python Environment**: Virtual environment with all dependencies installed
- **✅ Google AI API**: Connected with Gemini 1.5 Flash model
- **✅ Agent Configuration**: Both agents fixed to use correct server address
- **✅ Environment Setup**: `.env` file with API keys, `requirements.txt` complete

### Files Created/Modified Today
- `requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies
- `.env` - Environment variables with Google AI API key
- `test_setup.py` - Comprehensive verification script
- `agents/slim_mail_composer.py` - Fixed SLIM server address
- `agents/slim_mail_validator` - Fixed to use environment variables
- `docs/references.md` - Complete list of files read during analysis

### Test Results (All Passed ✅)
- Environment Variables: ✅
- SLIM Bindings: ✅  
- Google AI API: ✅
- SLIM Server Connection: ✅

### Next Steps (Not Yet Done)
1. **Test mail validator agent** - Start and verify it connects to SLIM server
2. **Test mail composer agent** - Verify it can find and communicate with validator
3. **End-to-end workflow** - Generate email → validate → receive response

### Agent Details
- **Mail Composer**: `agntcy/mailcomposer/composer` (generates emails using Gemini)
- **Mail Validator**: `agntcy/mailcomposer/validator` (validates email content)
- **Communication**: Request-Response pattern via SLIM

### Ready for Testing
Infrastructure is complete. Next session should focus on agent-to-agent communication testing.
