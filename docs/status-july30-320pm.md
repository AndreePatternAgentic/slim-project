# Status Update - July 30, 3:20 PM

## Goal: Two Agents Communicating via SLIM

**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

## What Works
- Two separate agent processes successfully communicate through SLIM data plane server
- Real bidirectional message exchange working
- Human-readable agent IDs preserved (`cisco/default/agent_a`, `cisco/default/agent_b`)

## How to Use
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Agent B (receiver)
python authenticated_agents.py

# Terminal 2 - Start Agent A (sender)
python authenticated_agents.py sender

# Or run integrated test
python authenticated_agents.py test
```

## Essential Files
- **`authenticated_agents.py`** - Complete working solution (only file needed)
- **`docs/slim-agent-id-mismatch-fix.md`** - Documentation of ID mismatch fix

## Key Fix Applied
- Rebuilt SLIM Python bindings with authentication support
- Used `PyIdentityProvider.SharedSecret` pattern
- Resolved agent ID transformation issue that was preventing communication

## Test Results
```
Agent A: Sending: 'Hello from authenticated Agent A!'
Agent B: RECEIVED: 'Hello from authenticated Agent A!'
Agent B: SENT REPLY: 'Authenticated reply from Agent B: Hello from authenticated Agent A!'
Agent A: Received reply: 'Authenticated reply from Agent B: Hello from authenticated Agent A!'
ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS! Authenticated agent communication working!
```

**Goal achieved - agents can now communicate via SLIM infrastructure using proper authentication patterns.**
